# Data Management Skills Assessment

## What I Know: Strongest Competencies, Skills, and Knowledge
The skills in the Data Management domain have some overlap with the Data Analytics domain. I have two main strengths in both domains:
1.	Data wrangling using Python
Python has become one of my core strengths. Skills I have acquired: load, clean, merge, transform, and analyze data from multiple sources and formats (web, database, csv, text, json etc) using Pandas.  as well as create insightful visualizations with Matplotlib. 
2.	SQL
SQL is one of my strongest skills. I also use SQL extensively in my job. I can design and implement a relational database and create complex queries to extract meaningful patterns and insights from the data. I can translate business requirements into SQL and prepare/retrieve the desired data. I can design database schema for applications and create/maintain database objects. I am proficient in advanced SQL like analytical functions. 

These skills form a solid foundation for data analytics project, from data preparation, retrieval, and visualization.

## Where I am Weak: Areas for Improvement
1.	SQL query performance optimization
I am learning about SQL query performance optimization. It doesnâ€™t make much difference when working with a small to medium amount of data, but it needs to be taken into consideration when dealing with a huge amount of data.

## What I Wish I Knew or May Be Missing
1.	NoSQL databases
I am not familiar with NoSQL databases like MongoDB etc. There are situations these databases are more suitable for applications. I am planning to learn it when I have time.

## Summary of Capabilities and Future Applications

I have developed a strong foundation in data analytics, particularly in data wrangling (Python, SQL, Excel), visualization (Power BI, Tableau, Excel). These skills make me well-prepared for integrating complex data from multiple sources and find insights/patterns through data analysis, reporting, and dashboard creation.
