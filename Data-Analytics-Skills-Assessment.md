# Data Analytics Skills Assessment

## What I Know: Strongest Competencies, Skills, and Knowledge
1.	Data wrangling using Python
Python has become one of my core strengths. Skills I acquired: load, clean, merge, transform, and analyze data from multiple sources and formats using Pandas, as well as create insightful visualizations with Matplotlib. 
2.	SQL
SQL is one of my strongest skills. I also use SQL extensively in my job. I can design and implement a relational database and create complex queries to extract meaningful patterns and insights from the data.
3.	Excel
Although Excel may not be the most efficient tool for data analysis, I can use it to calculate statistics and create quick visualization to present the findings. The built-in Power Query editor is a handy tool for data preparation, merging and appending.
4.	Tableau
I learned Tableau in the course. I use Power BI a lot in my job. These tools have a lot of similarities. I can create complex data reports using them.

These skills form a solid foundation for data analytics project, from data preparation, retrieval, and visualization.

## Where I am Weak: Areas for Improvement
1.	RapidMiner
RapidMiner is a data science platform that allows for the creation of machine learning models and predictive analytics. I learned it in the course, but I donâ€™t have much hands-on experience using this tool.
2.	Machine learning modeling techniques
This area involves a lot of statistical and machine learning modeling knowledge. Without extensive experience and thorough understanding in these areas, I am not very confident about accomplishing complex tasks with high accuracy

## What I Wish I Knew or May Be Missing
1.	Advanced statistical knowledge: While I have a good foundation in statistics and quantitative analysis, I need more practical experience to gain a deeper understanding.
2.	Advanced machine learning techniques: This area also takes experience to be proficient and make sound judgement, especially in terms of model selection, evaluation etc.

## Summary of Capabilities and Future Applications

I have developed a strong foundation in data analytics, particularly in data wrangling (Python, SQL, Excel), visualization (Power BI, Tableau, Excel). These skills make me well-prepared for integrating complex data from multiple sources and find insights/patterns through data analysis, reporting, and dashboard creation.
