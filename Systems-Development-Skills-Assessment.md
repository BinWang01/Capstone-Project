# Systems Development Skills Assessment

## What I Know: Strongest Competencies, Skills, and Knowledge
1.	Frontend web development
I’m proficient in HTML, CSS, vanilla javascript, and libraries like jQuery, Alpine.js. I took some courses on react.js and vue.js, but I haven’t used those frameworks in production projects. I have used Bootstrap in several web projects that are running in production. 
2.	Backend web development
I’m proficient in C#, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, PHP, and Laravel, which I used on my job and hobby to build web applications and tools. I learned Python programming in the courses I took. I find Python has very concise and clean syntax. I built a small site using Django in CIDM 6325. I think I can use Django to build larger project. There are a lot of similarities between those backend web frameworks. 
3.	SQL
SQL is one of my strongest skills. I also use SQL extensively in my job. I can design and implement a relational database and create complex queries to extract meaningful patterns and insights from the data.

These skills form a solid foundation for building static website as well as data-driven web applications. 

## Where I am Weak: Areas for Improvement
1.	Github
I don’t use Github very often because it’s not necessary for my situation.
2.	Writing tests for my own code
I’m not in the habit of writing test for my code yet. Although I haven’t experienced major issues with my code in the past, it’s a good habit to write tests so I can introduce new functionalities and refactor existing code with ease.

## What I Wish I Knew or May Be Missing
1.	Containerization technologies like docker and kubernetes. In the past I only deployed my code from local development environment directly to a physical or virtual server, without a container package being involved. I wish I can learn the container technologies to improve the delivery method.
2.	AWS Cloud. Most of the time I deploy my application to on-premise servers. I have used digital ocean’s droplets before, but I have never used serverless or CI.

## Summary of Capabilities and Future Applications

I have strong foundation in full-stack web development with a focus on backend technologies and database management. Seeking to enhance skills in modern development practices including version control, testing, containerization, and cloud technologies to round out the skill set and improve overall development capabilities.
