## What I Know: Competencies, Skills, and Knowledge
Throughout my academic journey in the Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics program, I have developed a strong foundation in various technical and analytical skills. Here are the areas where I feel most confident and proficient:

### 1. Python Programming and Data Wrangling
Python has become one of my core strengths, serving as a powerful tool across multiple courses and applications. Skills I acquired:
Data Analysis: several projects on my Github page demonstrate my ability to load, clean, merge, transform, and analyze data from multiple sources and formats using Pandas, as well as create insightful visualizations with Matplotlib.
Basic machine learning: I completed several courses on datacamp.com and implemented several unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms using Python packages.
To deepen my Python skills, I read several technical books and watched multiple video courses. I also practice regularly by writing Python code. 

### 2. SQL and Database Management
SQL is one of my strongest skills, as evidenced by my performance in multiple courses. I also use SQL extensively in my job.
In the courses, I designed and implemented a relational database and created complex queries to extract meaningful insights from the data. I also applied advanced SQL techniques to detect potential fraud in the transaction data.

### 3. Data Analysis and Visualization
I've developed strong skills in data analysis and visualization, particularly with Python, Tableau, Matplotlib, and Excel. My job uses Power BI extensively. I have applied the knowledge I learned in the program to my job and my experience reinforced my knowledge in turn. 

### 4. Web Development
I've gained significant proficiency in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Django. 
The web development project in CIDM 6325 demonstrated my ability to create a full-stack web application using Django, incorporating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and interactive user experience.
I also built a fraud detection website using HTML, CSS, and Alpinejs.
I also supplemented my coursework with online courses and books.

## Where I'm Weak: Areas for Improvement
While I've made significant progress in many areas, there are some skills and knowledge areas where I feel less confident:

### 1. Big Data Technologies
Big data technologies like Apache Spark and Streamlit were briefly mentioned in one of the courses, but not explored in depth. 
To address this weakness, I plan to take online courses specifically focused on Big Data technologies. I've identified relevant courses on platforms like Pluralsight and Coursera that cover Apache Spark and Streamlit.

### 2. Advanced Machine Learning
I havenâ€™t spent enough time to dig deeper into the following aspects of machine learning:
Algorithm selection and model design;
Performance evaluation.
To strengthen my machine learning skills, I intend to work through practical projects on Kaggle, focusing on algorithm selection and model evaluation. I also plan to take more courses on datacamp.

### 3. Network Administration and Cybersecurity
Areas of improvement:
Detecting cyber-attacks and enforcing organizational security plans.
To enhance my skills in this area, I plan to pursue relevant certifications such as CompTIA Security+ and Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP). I will also practice with tools like WireShark and Nessus in controlled environments to gain hands-on experience.

## What I Wish I Knew More About
1. Cloud Computing: While not explicitly mentioned in the courses, I recognize the growing importance of cloud technologies in modern IT infrastructures. I wish to gain more knowledge about platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
2. Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning: Although I have some knowledge on machine learning, I'd like to delve deeper into AI and deep learning techniques, particularly their applications in business analytics.
3. Agile Project Management: As I prepare to transition into a project manager role, I realize the importance of understanding agile methodologies in software development and project management.

## Summary
Throughout my academic journey in this program, I have developed a strong foundation in Python programing, data analytics, web development, and database management. My proficiency in Python, SQL, data visualization tools, and web technologies positions me well for developing a successful capstone project that demonstrates my competencies in data analytics, data management, software systems, and networking and cybersecurity.
