# Networking and Cybersecurity Skills Assessment

## What I Know: Strongest Competencies, Skills, and Knowledge
1.	Networking knowledge\
I have basic knowledge about computer networking. The course CIDM 6340 served as a great refresher. In the past I have used firewall router, switch to setup network for a small business. I can configure windows server to provide services like DNS/DHCP to devices in the network. I can also setup web server and database server to host web applications.
2.	Cybersecurity awareness\
Through the courses and reading on the Internet, I have some knowledge about common cybersecurity issues in IT environment and how to mitigate/recover from them. I have developed the awareness of actions to take to avoid common security issues. 
3.	Web application security\
When learning to build web applications, I read about the “OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities” and how to avoid them in code.
4.	Fraud detection\
I learned how to detect fraud using machine learning in CIDM 6356. While not in-depth, it’s a good starting point for further study

## Where I am Weak: Areas for Improvement
1.	Practical security testing\
During the course CIDM 6340, I used tools like Nmap, WireShark, ShieldsUp, and Nessus to scan my home network. I got a basic understanding of the tools, but I still need to use them in a real IT environment to be able to detect cybersecurity issues and come up with sound solutions.
2.	Web applications penetration testing\
When writing code for web applications, I follow best practice to avoid the most common vulnerabilities, e.g SQL injection, csrf, xss etc. But I have never performed a real penetration test against my application. I would like to try it and look at cybersecurity from a different perspective. 

## What I Wish I Knew or May Be Missing
1.	Advanced machine learning for cybersecurity\
I think the study in these courses gave me a good starting point to explore further. I wrote code to implement several scikit-learn algorithms and evaluated the performance. But it’s not in-depth enough to be able to elaborate the differences between the algorithms and make sound decision as to which one to use to solve specific business problems. Deeper understanding of various machine learning algorithms, packages, and their applications is still missing.

## Summary of Capabilities and Future Applications

I have possessed a solid foundation in networking and basic cybersecurity concepts, with practical experience in small-scale network setup and web application development. I have gained understanding of common security threats and best practices for mitigation. I’m seeking to enhance skills in practical security testing, both for networks and web applications, to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. I am also aiming to deepen understanding of machine learning applications in cybersecurity for more effective fraud detection and problem-solving capabilities.
